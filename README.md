Simulates popular page replacement algorithms used in operating systems to manage memory when RAM's feeling a little too full. Perfect for students, OS nerds, or anyone trying to make page faults look cool.

📌 What's Inside?
   FIFO – Oldest page gets kicked out. Classic boomer move.
   LRU – The “you haven’t called me in a while” algorithm.
   Optimal – Knows the future (cheating, but fine).
   Optional: MRU, Clock, Second-Chance (for bonus flex)# Operating-System-project
